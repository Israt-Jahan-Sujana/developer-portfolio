            <h3>Web Developer and Cartoon-Painter</h3>
            <p>I'm studying CSE in IUB. Whenever I get time I try to paint on t-shirt and I love to do that. Now I'm
                learning web development and last semester I've learned a little bit of python. These seem so fun and
                interesting. I want to learn more of these.</p>

            <h1>Dream Big</h1>
            <h2>Become a web developer</h2>
            <p>I have already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. I can even teach my friend
                how to make simple website. My goal is to learn more advanced things and get a job first. I want to be
                economically independant. Then I want to travel in many countries and buy my own things with my own
                money. That is one of my biggest dreams.</p>

                <p>I will be the master of HTML. I am now learning. I have to be more confident and I have to practise more and more. I'm learning very slowly and I don't like it. I want to learn faster. So I have to stick to a good routine as soon as possible.</p>

                <p>So what will I write now? Ok lets write about in which form I want to transform myself. First of all I want to loose my weight at least 6 kg more. My another concern is that I'm facing some skin problems. To get rid of it really I have to keep patience.Though it's getting hard to keep patience about this because skin is sensitive so I just can't apply anything and experiment on my skin.</p>
