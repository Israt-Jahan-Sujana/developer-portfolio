            <p>I'm studying in CSE in IUB. Whenever I get time I try to paint on t-shirt and I love to do that. Now I'm
                learning web development and last semester I've learned a little bit of python. These seem so fun and
                interesting. I want to learn more of these.</p>

            <h1>Dream Big</h1>
            <h2>Become a web developer</h2>
            <p>I have already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. I can even teach my friend
                how to make simple website. My goal is to learn more advanced things and get a job first. I want to be
                economically independant. Then I want to travel in many countries and buy my own things with my own
                money. That is one of my biggest dreams.</p>
